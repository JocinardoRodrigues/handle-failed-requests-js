# handle-failed-requests-js

Implementation of (https://github.com/hubspot/offline)[Offline-js] with some improvements

# Why?
Because Offline-js has some bugs and inconsistency

* Promises support
* Save ALL the failed requests, not just the last one
* Send all failed requests when connection is up again
* No need configuration

# How

´´´js
var req = new Request();

// default method is post
req.send('/', data)
.then(function(res) {
    console.log(res)
})

// or
req.send({
    method: 'post',
    data: data,
    url: '/'
    })
.then(function(res) {
    console.log(res)
})    
´´´

I´m working on it to remove the offline-js dependency
